Perceptrons

Perceptron is a neuron that precess the data and construction an structure with forge a network with another perceptron.

what is the input ? - input can anything. for example a number , situation or what affect my selections.

basically perceptron take a input form back (there can another perceptron) and give it an weight and collect with bias at the perceptron. according to that perceptron 
give an output. but before that there is a important stop station: Activation Function


Cost Function - measure what is the our distance to data. our goal is minimize the cost function.Gradient Descent is a optimization function for minimize the cost
function
